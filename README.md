# Astra Industries

A hackathon project extending [Forma OSS](https://github.com/caid-technologies/Forma-OSS) by CAID Technologies into room-scale spatial design.

**Live app:** https://astra-industries.vercel.app

See the [persistent workspace guide](docs/workspace.md) for cloud saves, instance transforms, keyframe animation, and the complete import → arrange → save → animate → export workflow.

Optional private geometry/GIF storage: [cloud storage setup and lifecycle](docs/cloud-storage.md). Enable with `VITE_CLOUD_STORAGE_ENABLED=true` after applying its migrations; the device library and core Auth/Postgres work with it disabled.

## Vision

Design set pieces, workstations, and equipment layouts for fabrication shops, manufacturing spaces, and laboratories. Build hardware projects with Forma, import existing Forma projects or plain STEP files, place them in a 3D room, and animate how the space works.

## Planned workflow

1. Build a project using Forma OSS, or bring an existing Forma project or STEP model.
2. Import the design as a reusable scene asset with consistent physical units.
3. Configure a room and arrange multiple assets at real-world scale.
4. Preview object motion and assembly or workflow sequences with a simple animation timeline.
5. Save and reopen the room layout for further iteration.

## Initial scope

- Forma OSS integration for project creation and handoff.
- Forma project import, including available mechanical geometry and metadata.
- Standalone .step and .stp import and display.
- Interactive 3D room viewer and layout tools.
- Basic keyframe animation and playback.
- Scene persistence and representative fabrication, manufacturing, and lab demos.

## Upstream integration

Forma provides hardware generation, versioned project objects, and mechanical layouts. Its reusable Python distribution is caid-forma-core (import package: forma_core). Integration details and supported project versions will be established in the implementation issues.

Upstream Forma OSS is licensed under MPL-2.0; preserve applicable notices and license obligations when reusing upstream code.

## Status

The workbench supports Forma/STEP imports, stable editable instances, room dimensions, component inspection, keyframe animations, shared-pose GIF exports, portable scene JSON, authenticated Postgres scene saves, and optional private geometry/GIF storage. Forma generation can run separately; its local CLI bridge remains available for development.

## Run locally

Requires Node 22 and Python 3.11+.

```powershell
npm install
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-forma.txt
npm run build
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8787. For development use `npm run dev` and http://127.0.0.1:5173.

On macOS/Linux use `.venv/bin/python` for pip installation. Forma is installed through `caid-forma-core==0.3.5`; no Forma source checkout is required. The distribution provides the `forma-oss` and `forma-core` commands. Astra invokes `python -m forma_core` from this environment.

Use **Build with Forma → Deterministic demo** to verify the full creation/import flow without provider credentials. For live generation, configure the appropriate provider environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`) and enter its provider/model in the UI. Live provider calls have not yet been verified in this project.

### Optional Forma MCP demo

The repository includes a project-local OpenCode configuration for the Forma OSS MCP server. It is local-only and does not affect the Vercel build or browser bundle. Astra's file import and existing local generation bridge continue to work when Forma MCP is not installed or running.

In a second checkout, start Forma OSS using its documented setup:

```powershell
py -3 .\scripts\development\setup-opencode.py --root . --workspace "$HOME\forma-workspace" --install-cli
.\scripts\development\dev.ps1
```

The Forma backend must be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`. Then, from this Astra checkout:

```powershell
opencode mcp list
opencode
```

Use the `/forma-demo` command in OpenCode. It compiles a validated project to `demo/forma-project.json`; import that file into Astra with **Import project**. The generated `demo/` directory is ignored by Git. Restart OpenCode after changing `opencode.json` because project configuration is loaded at startup.

If the MCP server is unavailable, use the deterministic Forma demo or import an existing Forma JSON/STEP project as usual.

### Animation feedback loop

Render **Authored timeline animation** in GIF studio, enter feedback such as a clearance or motion change, and choose **Send feedback to Forma**. Astra saves a scrubbed review package to `.astra/feedback/latest.json`; it contains the room manifest, sampled frame poses, animation tracks, and the instruction, but not credentials or geometry secrets.

In OpenCode, run `/forma-feedback`. It reads the review, updates the Forma project through `forma.opencode.update_project`, and writes the revised compiled manifest back to `demo/forma-project.json`. Reimport that manifest into Astra and render the animation again. This is intentionally a human-reviewed loop; Astra never silently changes electrical or mechanical design data.

### Astra CLI

Install the local CLI from this checkout:

```powershell
npm install
npm link
astra auth login
```

`astra auth login` opens GitHub and stores the Supabase session in the user's Astra CLI config. Add `http://127.0.0.1:54331/callback` to the Supabase Auth redirect allowlist for the deployed Supabase project, or set `ASTRA_CLI_REDIRECT_URL` to an allowlisted callback. The CLI uses the same Astra account as the browser.

```powershell
astra rooms list
astra rooms validate .\astra-scene.json
astra rooms import .\astra-scene.json --name "Lab demo"
astra rooms export <room-id> .\astra-scene.json
astra auth logout
```

The browser workbench remains the local room editor and can import/export portable scene JSON without signing in. The CLI transfers those manifests to and from cloud; binary geometry is not uploaded by the CLI and can be attached from Astra when cloud storage is enabled.

## Import contracts

- Forma: Hardware IR 0.1/0.2, `project_ir` / `hardware_ir` wrappers, `forma-project` manifest v1, and `forma.project` namespace objects. Object versions are revision counters. Mechanical placements and inline CAD mesh vertices use millimeters with Z up.
- SDK/agent handoff: see [`docs/forma-handoff.md`](docs/forma-handoff.md) for the canonical compiled artifact contract used by the Forma SDK, OpenCode, and Codex.
- Select referenced STEP artifacts together with their Forma JSON. Missing CAD falls back to labeled mechanical envelopes when available; otherwise the import reports an error. Remote CAD URLs and server-local paths are not fetched automatically.
- STEP: `.step` and `.stp` Part 21 files are converted with `occt-import-js@0.0.23`. OpenCascade reads source units; the UI provides source-up-axis and scale correction. Geometry conversion runs in an isolated worker with a 120-second timeout. Successful conversions are cached for repeated imports.
- Scene asset schema v1: stable content-derived asset/part IDs, source filename/digest/project identity, named hierarchy, indexed triangle meshes, dimensions, and warnings. All geometry is normalized to meters, Y up, centered in X/Z and floor-aligned; `originOffset` retains the original normalization offset. Metadata is allowlisted for display.
- Limits: 25 MiB per file, 75 MiB per batch, 2 million vertices per asset. These are protective caps, not a benchmarked performance guarantee. STEP variants and large assemblies need broader fixture validation.

## Verification

With `npm start` running, run `npm test`. The Chrome smoke test checks Forma import, actual STEP conversion using an upstream cube fixture, room controls, invalid JSON recovery, and pip-installed Forma deterministic generation. Screenshots are written to `test-results/`. Chrome and network access for the STEP fixture are required.

## Third-party software

Forma Core is consumed as a pip dependency under MPL-2.0. STEP conversion uses occt-import-js and its OpenCascade/WebAssembly distribution; retain their bundled license notices when redistributing. Upstream test geometry used by the smoke test is fetched from the occt-import-js test suite rather than included in this repository.

## GIF studio and asset library

Open **GIF studio** in the viewer (also available in fullscreen). Everything in this workflow runs in the browser; no Forma process, provider credentials, upload service, or server-side rendering is required.

### Export for visual review

1. Import your Forma/STEP assets and open **Floor export**.
2. Choose **Entire room**, **Floor section**, or **Selected asset**. A section is defined by its X/Z center and width/depth in meters, relative to the room center. Its box is highlighted in the viewport. It must fit within the room and intersect an asset; geometry outside its six boundaries is clipped in the export.
3. Choose 320, 480, or 640 pixels square, a 2–4 second duration, and 10 or 15 fps. Click **Render GIF**; progress and cancellation are available.
4. Inspect the animated preview, then download the GIF and its review metadata JSON. Metadata records source asset IDs, names, provenance, instance positions, units, room/section dimensions, motion mode, frame timing, and geometry approximation warnings. Supply both files to a visual-review agent to preserve spatial context. Astra does not automatically call an LLM or apply corrections.

**Turntable** makes one complete camera orbit around fixed geometry. Selected assets can also use **Sample lift-and-return**, a clearly labeled synthetic motion with a stationary camera. It is a preview preset, not an authored animation timeline or physics simulation. Captures use a separate renderer and never modify the active room or camera.

GIF timing is rounded to the format's 10 ms tick: 15 fps becomes 70 ms/frame. Metadata and preview report the actual duration. At most 60 frames are encoded; frames are processed sequentially with UI yields, and temporary render resources are disposed on completion, failure, or cancellation. GIFs use a 256-color palette per frame, so some color quantization is expected.

### Build a reusable asset library

1. Select a room asset, open **Asset library**, and click **Save selected asset to library**.
2. Render a **turntable** or **sample motion** preview from its card. The latest GIF and review metadata are saved with its geometry in IndexedDB. Saving the same asset ID updates its existing entry.
3. Refresh or reopen Astra on the same browser origin: library entries and previews remain. **Add to room** restores an instance without reimporting the source file. **Remove from library** deletes the stored asset and preview while leaving existing room instances intact.

The device library is per browser/device/origin and subject to browser quota and eviction. Use the explicit Cloud files actions for private geometry/GIF transfers. Cloud scenes can be saved and reopened after reload through **Save / open scenes**; portable scene JSON also bundles geometry and animation without a cloud dependency.

### GIF checks

With the app running on port 8787, run `npm run test:gif`. It imports deterministic fixtures, renders and decodes real GIF downloads to check dimensions, moving frames, timing and looping, verifies section filtering/metadata, tests library persistence and both motion presets, and covers cancellation, fullscreen, and mobile layout. No Forma installation or external fixture download is needed for this suite. Run `npm run test:fullscreen` for the existing fullscreen regressions. Screenshots are saved under `test-results/10-*.png`.

GIF encoding uses `gifenc` (MIT); the test-only GIF decoder is `omggif` (MIT).

## Vercel deployment

`vercel.json` deploys the Vite frontend with `npm ci`, `npm run build`, and output directory `dist`. The project is linked to `isayahcs-projects/astra-industries` on Vercel.

Production/preview environment variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: the Supabase project URL.
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: the public browser key (never a service-role/secret key).
- `VITE_FORMA_GENERATION_ENABLED=false`: hides local-only Forma generation controls; generate projects with Forma separately, then import them into Astra.

The deployment serves rendering, imports, GIF exports, local asset library, and GitHub Auth. The Node/Python generation server is not deployed. `.vercelignore` excludes environment files, virtual environments, local databases/caches, server code, Supabase config, and test screenshots.

The Supabase production Site URL and redirect allowlist include `https://astra-industries.vercel.app`; GitHub's OAuth callback remains `https://mrhxfmtofvrgfaikllfw.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`. Preview deployment origins must be explicitly allowed before using OAuth on them.

Deploy the current checkout with `vercel deploy --prod --yes --scope isayahcs-projects`. Validate public rendering/imports/GIFs with `node scripts/deployment-smoke.mjs`. Set `ASTRA_BASE_URL=https://astra-industries.vercel.app` when running `node scripts/auth-live-smoke.mjs` to check the production GitHub redirect without signing in.
